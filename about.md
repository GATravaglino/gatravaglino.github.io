## CP&G Lab Director

I joined the [School of Law & Social Sciences, Department of Law & Criminology](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/law-and-criminology/) at Royal Holloway, University of London in 2021 as Associate Professor of Criminology and Psychology. Previously I held faculty positions at the University of Kent (Assistant Professor of Social & Organisational Psychology) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, SZ (Assistant Professor of Applied Psychology). I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Dominic Abrams. In 2012, I founded [Contention](/contention) and since 2015 I co-edit the journal with Dr Benjamin Abrams. 

### Research

My expertise is in the Social Psychology of Intergroup and Intragroup Processes, with a specific focus on the nexus among Crime, Culture and Politics. My research has examined in what circumstances people tend to punish (or forgive) transgressions from group members. Another line of my work has examined how cultural values enable criminal groups to gain legitimacy in society. My research has been funded by the ESRC, the British Academy, and The Royal Society.
